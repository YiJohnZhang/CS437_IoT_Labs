# Final Project Proposal Overview
- **Proposal Specs**: 500 - 750 words
- **Sections**:
	- **Motivation**: explain the purpose of your project, the problem it is trying to solve, and why someone should care about that problem..
	- **Timeline**: list the specific deliverables you plan to produce in the project. Don’t just say the end result, break the result into pieces - it is good to have intermediate checkpoints when you develop something. Specify when you plan to complete each item.
	- **Group**: if you’re working in a group, list the other people in their group (name and also netid).
	- **Contribution**: briefly describe the contribution that each group member will make to the project

|Section|Quality|Points|
|-|-|-|
|Motivation|Clear and convincing|20|
|Project topic|important and interesting|20|
|Technical Feasibility|Proposed project is technically sound and will extend skill sets of participants|20|
|Milestones|clearly described and realistic|40|
|Novel/Creative*|Topic/idea is novel/creative -- problem not solved by existing products, hasn't been done in prior instances of class|**30 extra credit points**|

**\*Note**: Proposal is 10% of final grade. This is a whole 3 points added to your grade (**A+ = 100%+ in this class**)

# Final Project Submission Overview
campuswire: page 4: final project rubic paper items add to 90, not 100
- Rubric:
|**Paper**|100|
|Motivation|*20*|
|Technical approach|*25*|
|Implementation details|*25*|
|Results|*20*|
|**Video** (<= 10 minute demo video)|60|
|**Overall Project**|40|
|**Skill-building**/Comfort Zone: did the project cause the group members to extend their skill sets? Did you learn the specific new things you had set out to learn, or were you able to do everything using only your prior knowledge (not as good)?||
|**Innovation**: was the project “new” in some way? Was the idea itself new, or was some new technique used to approach an existing idea, or did the students substantially build upon existing research? Or did it bring something new into the student’s life?||
|**Total**|**200**|

- **Submission Paper Guidelines**:
	- **Motivation**: this should be more detailed than your initial writeup. Talk about the importance of this problem. Pretend you are trying to convince someone to give you funding, or purchase what you developed. You may also want to give references/citations here.
	- **Technical Approach**: describe the technical approach you used to complete your work. You can give your overall architecture, describe how data flows through your system, describe algorithms you developed, provide circuit diagrams, etc. Provide anything important in understanding *how* you did what you did.
	- **Implementation Details**: this is where you give the details in your implementation. Talk about specific software packages you used, hardware modules, any algorithms or research papers you referred to, data structure and protocol choices, etc. You should provide at least an informal list of citations of all these external materials that went into your project.
	- **Results**: so, how did things turn out? You can provide performance results, experiences you had interacting with it, etc. Also talk about what the takeaway is - why should we care about your results? And, it is ok for things to go wrong - what did not go right in your project, what was hard and what lessons did you learn?
	- **Contribution**: If you worked in a group, each member’s contribution should be clearly stated at the end of the paper. The report will not be graded if this section is missing.
- **Video Guidelines**:
	- should not go over 10 minutes
	- A demo of your project. Walk the viewer through how to use it. Please speak while you are doing this, explain what is going on on the screen.
